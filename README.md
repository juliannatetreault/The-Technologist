# THE TECHNOLOGIST APP

The Technologist is a Rails and JavaScript-based application that allows users to create byte-sized tech reviews. Users can choose to create an account of their own to publish and read reviews. If a user chooses to bypass creating an account, that user still has the ability to read reviews from other account-holding publishers.

## Usage

 * To use The Technologist, `fork` and `clone` this repository onto your local machine. 
 * Run `bundle install` in your terminal.
 * Run `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed` in your terminal.
 * Run `rails s` in your terminal and in the browser of your choice, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.
 * Finally, create an account either through your email, or the third party Github login.
